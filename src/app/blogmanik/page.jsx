              Sometimes all you need is a quick weekend trip to clear your head, and for me, 
              Bir Billing and Rajgunda were just that. A break from the noise, some fresh mountain air, 
              and a mix of chill moments and light adventure.

            <h2>Day 1 â€“ Scooty rides, monastery vibes & a sunset to remember</h2>
            
            <p>
              We reached Bir afternoon-before lunch, slightly tired from the overnight journey but still excited. 
              The moment we stepped out of the traveller, the cool breeze and quiet surroundings instantly made me feel calm.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              After settling in and grabbing some food, we decided to rent a scooty and explore the area on our own. 
              It honestly felt great to ride through those open roads, with hills in the distance and barely any traffic.
            </p>
            
            {/* <div className="mukteshwar-image-container">

             */}
            <p>
              Our first stop: <span className='fw-bolder'>Chokling Monastery</span>. The prayer flags fluttering in the wind, monks quietly walking around, 
              and the peaceful aura of the place made me want to just sit there for a while and take it all in. 
              It reminded me how rarely we allow ourselves to slow down.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Post that, we went to <span className='fw-bolder'>CafÃ© Hopping</span>. Bir is full of nice little cafÃ©sâ€”wooden interiors, mountain views, 
              friendly locals, and surprisingly great food.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Later in the evening, we rode up to <span className='fw-bolder'>Northern CafÃ© </span>â€“ and it honestly became my favourite spot on the trip. 
              We found a cozy table overlooking the paragliding landing site, ordered siddu (a local Himachali dish I'd never 
              tried before â€“ and loved!), and just sat there watching the sunset behind the hills. The sky turned all shades 
              of orange and pink while gliders were landing below. One of those moments you want to bottle up forever.
            </p>

            <h2>Day 2 â€“ Hidden waterfalls, bumpy roads & bonfire dance parties</h2>
            
            <p>
              We kicked off the second day with a short hike to a<span className='fw-bolder'> hidden waterfall</span>. The trail was quiet, 
              with birds chirping and sunlight slipping through the trees. After about an hour, we reached 
              the waterfall â€“ small but super peaceful. We sat on the rocks, dipped our feet in the cold water, 
              and shared some piping hot momos we brought along. It felt like the perfect picnic spot tucked away from the world.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              After that, we hopped onto the back of a Bolero (yup, standing at the back â€“ full filmy style) 
              and started our drive towards <span className='fw-bolder'>Rajgunda Valley</span>. The ride was bumpy and full of twists, but honestly, 
              that made it even more fun. The views kept getting better â€“ snow-capped peaks, green meadows, 
              and small villages along the way.
            </p>

            <p>
              In Rajgunda, we went for a short hike nearby and reached a spot where we got an amazing view of 
              the <span className='fw-bolder'>Dhauladhar range</span>, with Thamsar Pass standing tall in the background. The air felt fresh. 
              The silence there was powerfulâ€”the kind that stays with you.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The best part of the day, though, was the night. After dinner, we lit a small bonfire. 
              Some locals joined us, someone played music on their phone, and soon, we were dancing under the stars. 
              Just music, fire, laughter and the mountains watching over us.

              We woke up early and drove up to<span className='fw-bolder'> Billing, the launch site for paragliding.</span> 
              Standing at the edge before take-off, I won't lie â€“ I was nervous.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              But once we were in the air, everything just... faded. The view from above â€“ green hills, 
              winding roads, scattered housesâ€¦ it felt like floating in a dream. Peaceful. Quiet. and absolutely beautiful!
            </p>
            
            <p>
              After landing near the Bir paragliding site, we had a quick breakfast at a nearby cafÃ© and just sat around, 
              not saying much â€“ I think we were all trying to soak in the last few moments before the journey back.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We left for Delhi in the evening, tired but happy. There was something about this trip â€“ 
              the balance of calm and excitement, the people we met, and those small unplanned moments â€“ 
              that made it really special.

              This trip reminded me how healing the mountains can be â€“ even if it's just for a couple of days. 
              Bir and Rajgunda gave me space to breathe, laugh, and live a little slower. 
              If you're thinking about going â€“ do it. You'll come back lighter.
